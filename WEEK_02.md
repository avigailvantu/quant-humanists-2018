# WEEK `02`: 29 Jan 2018
##  Track: Data, Representation, and Access in Tracking

This week in Quant Humanists, we will be thinking about representation and access in the world of self-tracking. Who are the target groups for these technologies? How do companies see the people they are looking to service? Who benefits (or is disadvantaged) because of self-tracking versus who could really use such technologies? How are people finding their own ways to track when the right tools don’t exist or when the larger institutional forces oppose them? How do we access the data we produce and what is its value?

## PROGRAM

**DISCUSSION**:

- Review projects gathered by the class (see week 1 assignment)
- Updates on class’s data collection, positives, pain-points, debugging, and more. 
- Quick primer on data, data formats, structuring data for analysis
- Short presentation on access and implications of having access or not having access to raw data, TODO:URL

**Project Highlight**

**STUDIO**
- Do a test export of your data collected so far, categorize data types and formats, and try to find at least two tools you could use to visualize/share those data.
