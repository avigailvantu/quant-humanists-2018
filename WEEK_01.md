# WEEK `01`: 22 Jan 2018
##  Track: Introduction to Quantified Humanists & Self-tracking

> "...self-experimentation with data forces us to wrestle with the uncertain line between evidence and belief, and how we come to decisions about what is and is not legitimate knowledge." - Neff, Gina. The Self-Tracking (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) (p. 18). The MIT Press. 

What is the Quantified Self? How are we represented by the data we produce? Are those representations meaningful? For whom? We will explore these questions and many more throughout this course, "Quant Humanists: the 'I' in API". Today, we will introduce some basics of this course, take care of some technical logistics, and dive into the quantified self experience.

## PROGRAM

**DISCUSSION:** 

- Introductions - happy to see yous!

**STUDIO:**

- Assign base/default questions + brainstorming about questions students are interested to answer through self-tracking ⇒ feedback about technologies and methods to do so
- Each group to come up with 5 questions, with at least 3 data types
- We’ll add these to a collaborative cluster and vote on a top 10 (?) list of questions
