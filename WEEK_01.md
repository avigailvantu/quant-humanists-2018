# WEEK `01`: 22 Jan 2018
##  Introduction to Quant Humanists

<center> <i>"...self-experimentation with data forces us to wrestle with the uncertain line between evidence and belief, and how we come to decisions about what is and is not legitimate knowledge."</i> - Neff, Gina. The Self-Tracking (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) (p. 18). The MIT Press. </center>

What is the Quantified Self? How are we represented by the data we produce? Are those representations meaningful? For whom? We will explore these questions and many more throughout this course, "Quant Humanists: the 'I' in API". Today we will introduce some basics of this course and take care of some technical logistics.

### ASSIGNMENT (DUE: WEEK `02`, 29 Jan 2018)
- **Task 1**: Setup a Github account
- **Task 2**: Setup self-tracking tools.
- **Task 3**: Begin using your self-tracking apps and develop the habit of tracking your life.
- **Task 4**: Write a short blog post (~ 250 - 500 words) about your initial expectations & perceptions about the aspects of your life you’ve begin to track. Please structure the post according to the template here: [Quant Humanist - assignment template](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/blob/master/_templates/Assignment-Template.md)
- **Task 5**: Gather 3-5 examples of projects, applications, and/or intriguing articles on the Quantified Self and Self-tracking. Find examples that are interesting or relevant to you and be ready to discuss them next class. Create a short blog post with a short description for each project including the URL and why you find it interesting or relevant. The idea is to help give us an overview of the work done in this space and also what interests you have in the realm of self-tracking. Please structure the post according to the template here: [Quant Humanist - assignment template](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/blob/master/_templates/Assignment-Template.md)
